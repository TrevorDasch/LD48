LD48
====
Thus begins the strange quest of creating a game in 48 hours from scratch. 

My journey begins with one word: 'alone'

My plan is to create a game very much like classic 'Galaga' with a twist using the 2D engine 'LOVE' which I have never used before. I will also be using the language lua for the first time, so this really will be quite the expiriment. 

I have approximately 1 day and 20 hours remaining. I believe I should begin.

[Fri 9:44 PM]
My Fedora box is being a jerk, so I'm going home to work on ubuntu. Also, hello world.

[Sat 12:06 AM]
Started working with lua and love. Love is pretty simple and easy to use, which is awesome. Lua isn't so much different from javascript really, except objects don't appear to be native, though its not to difficult to implement apparently. Right now I've got a ship moving around, and swinging around to face the mouse. Need to fix the transparency on the image.

[Sat 1:07 AM]
Started working on my enemy object. Right now I'm setting it up so that there will be 10 different enemy types. I might change this later. I should also work on a firing mechanic with a global bullet manager to handle all projectiles fired by anyone. Perhaps tomorrow morning.

[Sat 2:26 AM]
Decided that I wanted to work on particles, so I created a booster pixel spray from my rocket. It looks pretty awesome. It took me a while to figure out how to do it, but I'm glad I did. Done for today, more to come tomorrow morning.

[Sat 2:56 PM]
Spent the morning drawing all of my images. Also looked into the love framebuffer, which I think I'm going to use for my bullet hit detection.

[Sat 3:43 PM]
Created a framebuffer to act as the background image. Got it to scroll across the screen. 

[Sat 6:12 PM]
Wrote all the code for bullet creation, hit detection, and everything. Now I just need to do Enemy scripting.

[Sat 11:24 PM]
Created AI for all of my units, wrote in damage and everything. Almost done, just need a few bug fixes and maybe a health bar, a pause menu, a score, and a title screen

[Sun 12:04 PM]
The game is completely playable. I'm going to call it a night for LD48. Tomorrow is music and sound effect day, as well as my menus. Oh boy.

[Sun 10:57 AM]
The game has a title screen and a pause screen. Save games work, so now if you quit you restart in the same place. Starting music work now.
