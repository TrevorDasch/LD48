Thus begins the strange quest of creating a game in 48 hours from scratch. 

My journey begins with one word: 'alone'

My plan is to create a game very much like classic 'Galaga' with a twist using the 2D engine 'LOVE' which I have never used before. I will also be using the language lua for the first time, so this really will be quite the expiriment. 

I have approximately 1 day and 20 hours remaining. I believe I should begin.

My Fedora box is being a jerk, so I'm going home to work on ubuntu. Also, hello world.

Started working with lua and love. Love is pretty simple and easy to use, which is awesome. Lua isn't so much different from javascript really, except objects don't appear to be native, though its not to difficult to implement apparently. Right now I've got a ship moving around, and swinging around to face the mouse. Need to fix the transparency on the image.
