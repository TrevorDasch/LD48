Thus begins the strange quest of creating a game in 48 hours from scratch. 

My journey begins with one word: 'alone'

My plan is to create a game very much like classic 'Galaga' with a twist using the 2D engine 'LOVE' which I have never used before. I will also be using the language lua for the first time, so this really will be quite the expiriment. 

I have approximately 1 day and 20 hours remaining. I believe I should begin.
